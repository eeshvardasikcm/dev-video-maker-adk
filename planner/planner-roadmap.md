### Video Planner Roadmap (Manual Input & Workflow Focus)

**I. Core Objective (Manual Input & Workflow):**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop a "planner" component that guides users through a well-structured process for planning video content, with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness, primarily through manual input of presentation details.
* **MVP:** A user interface that allows developers to manually input key video parameters and presentation content, and generates a structured video plan outlining cost-saving strategies and efficient workflows.
* **Key Emphasis:** The tool should provide a clear, step-by-step process for translating ideas and content into a viable video plan, particularly for screenshot-based videos.

**II. Key Features (Manual Input Focused):**

* **Structured Manual Input:**
    * Provide clear fields for users to input their video topic, key messages, target audience, and desired video length.
    * Offer structured sections for outlining video content (e.g., scenes, talking points, visual ideas).
    * Include specific prompts to guide users in breaking down their presentation content into video segments.
    * Facilitate the manual entry of potential screenshots and their intended sequence.

* **Workflow Guidance:**
    * Present a clear, recommended workflow for video creation, from planning to editing.
    * Offer templates or frameworks for structuring different types of videos (e.g., tutorials, demos).
    * Provide checklists and prompts to ensure all necessary planning steps are considered.

* **Cost-Saving Strategies (Integrated):**
    * Offer context-sensitive tips and suggestions for cost-effective approaches at each stage of the manual planning process (e.g., planning for reusable assets, suggesting free software alternatives).
    * Encourage users to consider budget constraints during the initial planning phases.

* **Screenshot Optimization Guidance:**
    * Provide best practices for planning effective screenshot usage (e.g., clear visuals, minimal on-screen clutter, strategic annotations).
    * Offer advice on sequencing screenshots logically and pacing their display.

* **Iterative Planning:**
    * Allow users to easily revisit and refine their plan based on new ideas or constraints.
    * Provide options for organizing and rearranging planned content and screenshots.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focused - Manual Workflow):**

* **Phase 1: Core Planning Structure & Input UI:**
    * Design the fundamental structure for the video plan (e.g., sections for overview, content outline, visual plan, workflow).
    * Develop a user interface with clear and intuitive input fields for manual data entry.
* **Phase 2: Workflow Guidance & Cost-Saving Tips:**
    * Integrate the recommended video creation workflow into the planner interface.
    * Add context-sensitive cost-saving tips and best practices throughout the planning process.
* **Phase 3: Screenshot Planning Features:**
    * Implement specific features for planning screenshot usage, such as sequencing and annotation notes.
    * Refine the input fields and UI to effectively capture information relevant to screenshot-based videos.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch Goal): Plan Output & Export:**
    * Develop a way for users to view and export their completed video plan (e.g., as a text file, Markdown, or a simple structured document).

**IV. Why This Approach Maximizes Hackathon Potential (Manual Workflow):**

* **Simplified Scope:** Focusing on manual input and workflow guidance significantly reduces the complexity compared to automated importing.
* **Achievable MVP:** A functional planner with clear input fields and workflow guidance is a realistic goal for a Hackathon.
* **Provides Immediate Value:** Even without automation, a well-structured planning process can greatly improve efficiency and reduce costs for video creators.
* **Strong User Control:** Manual input ensures users have complete control over their plan and can tailor it precisely to their needs.

This revised roadmap prioritizes a robust and user-friendly manual planning process, which is a more manageable scope for a Hackathon while still delivering significant value. And for the `.md` file name, **`planner-roadmap.md`** still seems appropriate as it accurately describes the content.
