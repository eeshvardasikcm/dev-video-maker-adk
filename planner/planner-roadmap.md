### Video Planner Roadmap (Screenshot Sequence Workflow)

**I. Core Objective (Screenshot Sequence Planning):**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop a "planner" component that guides users through a focused process for structuring a video composed of a sequence of screenshots, emphasizing efficient organization and presentation.
* **MVP:** A user interface that allows developers to input the intended sequence of screenshots and add descriptive notes for each, forming the basis of a visual storyboard and presentation plan.
* **Key Emphasis:** The tool should provide a clear, step-by-step method for organizing screenshots and planning the accompanying narrative or annotations for an effective visual presentation.

**II. Key Features (Screenshot Sequencing Focus):**

* **Screenshot Sequence Input:**
    * Provide a straightforward way for users to define the order in which screenshots will appear in the video.
    * Allow users to add a brief description or key talking points associated with each screenshot.
* **Annotation Planning (Optional Notes):**
    * Include an optional field for users to jot down ideas for annotations (arrows, highlights, text) they might want to add to each screenshot later in the editing process.
* **Timing Considerations (Conceptual):**
    * Offer a general prompt for users to think about the desired duration or pacing for each screenshot in the sequence.
* **Workflow Outline (Screenshot Focused):**
    * Present a basic recommended workflow for creating screenshot-based videos (e.g., Plan Sequence -> Capture Screenshots -> Add Notes/Annotations -> Assemble in Editor -> Finalize).
* **Iterative Sequencing:**
    * Allow users to easily add, remove, and reorder screenshots within the planned sequence.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focused - Screenshot Sequence):**

* **Phase 1: Basic Screenshot Sequence UI:**
    * Design a simple interface where users can input the intended order of screenshots (e.g., using a list or drag-and-drop).
    * Implement the underlying data structure to store the sequence and associated descriptions.
* **Phase 2: Notes/Annotation Fields:**
    * Add optional fields for users to include notes or ideas for annotations related to each screenshot.
* **Phase 3: Workflow Guidance (Screenshot Video):**
    * Integrate a section outlining the basic workflow for creating videos from a sequence of screenshots.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch Goal): Simple Plan Output:**
    * Enable users to export their basic screenshot sequence plan (e.g., as a numbered list with descriptions).

**IV. Why This Approach Maximizes Hackathon Potential (Screenshot Sequence):**

* **Highly Specific Scope:** Focusing solely on the sequencing and description of screenshots simplifies the development significantly.
* **Achievable MVP:** A basic planner for ordering screenshots and adding notes is a very realistic Hackathon goal.
* **Directly Addresses the Use Case:** This approach directly supports the creation of videos that are primarily a series of screenshots.
* **Provides Immediate Organizational Value:** Even without video generation, this tool helps users organize their thoughts and the flow of their screenshot-based video.

For the `.md` file name, **`planner-roadmap.md`** still works well, or you could be slightly more specific with **`screenshot-sequence-planner-roadmap.md`**. Given your preference for shorter names, I'd still recommend **`planner-roadmap.md`** for simplicity.
