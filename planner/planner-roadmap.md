### Video Planner Roadmap (Template-Guided Screenshot Sequence)

**I. Core Objective (Template-Guided Screenshot Video):**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop a "planner" component that guides users through a streamlined process for creating screenshot-based videos, leveraging a template-like structure to simplify planning and potential video assembly.
* **MVP:** A user interface that allows developers to input the intended sequence of screenshots and associate key talking points with each, aligning with a basic underlying template for video creation.
* **Key Emphasis:** The tool should provide a straightforward method for organizing screenshots and their narrative flow, hinting at how the app itself could potentially structure the final video output.

**II. Key Features (Template-Focused):**

* **Screenshot Sequence Input with Narrative:**
    * Provide a clear way for users to define the order of screenshots.
    * Include a dedicated field for the essential narrative or key information to be conveyed with each screenshot.
* **Implicit Template Structure:**
    * The underlying design should implicitly suggest a basic video structure (e.g., intro screenshot/narrative, sequence of content screenshots/narrative, outro screenshot/narrative). This structure isn't explicitly user-configurable in the MVP but informs the input process.
* **Basic Workflow Guidance:**
    * Present a simplified workflow: Plan Sequence & Narrative -> Capture Screenshots -> (App-Guided) Assembly -> Finalize.
* **Iterative Sequencing & Narrative:**
    * Allow easy reordering of screenshots and editing of their associated narrative.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focused - Template Basis):**

* **Phase 1: Core Sequence & Narrative UI:**
    * Design the interface for inputting the ordered list of screenshots and their corresponding narrative.
    * Implement the data structure to store this information according to a basic template (even if not fully exposed to the user).
* **Phase 2: Implicit Template Integration:**
    * Ensure the UI and underlying data structure are aligned with a simple video template (e.g., a linear sequence of screenshot + narrative).
* **Phase 3: Basic Workflow Display:**
    * Briefly present the simplified workflow to guide the user's understanding of the process.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch Goal): Simple Plan Output/Potential App Integration Preview:**
    * Enable users to export their plan, potentially in a format that hints at how the app might assemble the video (e.g., a structured text file).

**IV. Why This Approach Maximizes Hackathon Potential (Template-Guided):**

* **Highly Focused and Streamlined:** This approach prioritizes the essential elements for a template-driven screenshot video.
* **Achievable MVP with Future Potential:** Creating a basic planner aligned with a template is manageable for a Hackathon and suggests the app's intended functionality.
* **Guides the User Towards Video Creation:** The implicit template helps users think in terms of a final video output, even without full generation capabilities in the MVP.
* **Reduces Planning Complexity:** By focusing on sequence and core narrative, it simplifies the user's planning task.

For the `.md` file name, **`planner-roadmap.md`** remains a good concise option. You could also consider **`template-guided-planner-roadmap.md`** if you want to emphasize the template aspect, but for brevity, **`planner-roadmap.md`** is likely sufficient.
