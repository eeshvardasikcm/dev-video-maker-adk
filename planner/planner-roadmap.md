### Developer Video Creator Roadmap (Manual Decision-Driven Indexing - Planning Phase)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a plan for a manual-entry UI tool for developers to index and document the sequential decisions and rationales made during the creation of a developer-focused video composed of screenshots, where the order of screenshots is determined by the manual capture process.

**II. Key Features:**

* Simple, manual UI for associating a captured screenshot (via file selection or similar) with a specific point in the video creation process.
* Primary focus: Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the decision, context, and rationale associated with the *current* screenshot through manual text input.
* Design for clear, manual indexing of decisions linked to the sequence of captured screenshots as they are added.
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" at the point of creation.

**III. Planning Stages (Hackathon Focus) & Documentation of Concepts:**

* **Phase 1: Conceptualization of Manual Input Interface:** Focus on outlining the fundamental design for how developers will manually input screenshots and the accompanying decision information.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - UI Concepts):** Create documentation detailing the proposed user interface concepts for the manual input process.
    * **Focus on the "Why" (of the UI Concept):** Document the reasoning behind the chosen high-level UI approach to ensure ease of use.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Information Display:** Focus on planning how the entered screenshots and their associated decision information will be displayed to the developer in a sequential manner.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Display Design):** Create documentation outlining the proposed design for presenting the sequential information.
    * **Focus on the "Why" (of the Display Design):** Document the rationale behind the chosen approach for displaying the sequence and associated data.

* **Phase 3: Outlining Basic Data Export:** Focus on planning a simple method for exporting the recorded screenshots and their decisions.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Export Outline):** Create documentation describing the proposed structure and format for the exported data.
    * **Focus on the "Why" (of the Format Outline):** Explain the reasoning behind the chosen basic export method.

* **Phase 4 (Stretch): Conceptualizing Potential Manual Reordering:** If time allows, brainstorm potential ways for developers to manually adjust the order of the recorded information.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Reordering Concepts):** Document any high-level conceptual ideas for manual reordering capabilities.

**IV. Why This Matters:**

* Focuses the Hackathon effort on planning a user-centric manual tool for documenting the developer video creation process.
* Prioritizes the design of a natural and intuitive experience for capturing the reasoning behind each visual element through manual input.
* Provides a conceptual foundation for potential future development of a tool to track the developer's thought process during video creation.
