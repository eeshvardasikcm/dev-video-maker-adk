### Video Planner Roadmap (Core Planning & Workflow)

**I. Core Objective (Focused Planning):**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop a "planner" component that guides users through a focused process for structuring video content and outlining a production workflow, emphasizing efficiency within development timelines.
* **MVP:** A user interface that allows developers to input their video topic and break down their content into sequential segments, forming the basis of a video plan and workflow.
* **Key Emphasis:** The tool should provide a clear, step-by-step method for organizing video content and considering the practicalities of its creation, particularly for scenarios where simple visual elements like screenshots are the primary output.

**II. Key Features (Core Planning Elements):**

* **Sequential Content Input:**
    * Provide a straightforward way for users to define the key sections or scenes of their video in a sequential order.
    * Offer a simple text field for describing the content of each segment (e.g., talking points, on-screen visuals).
* **Workflow Outline:**
    * Present a basic recommended workflow for video creation (e.g., Plan -> Record/Capture -> Edit -> Finalize).
    * Include prompts for users to consider the resources needed for each stage based on their content plan.
* **Practical Considerations:**
    * Incorporate prompts that encourage users to think about the time required for each segment and the overall project.
    * Offer general tips for efficient content presentation, keeping in mind potential limitations in visual complexity.

* **Iterative Structuring:**
    * Allow users to easily add, remove, and reorder video segments as their plan evolves.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focused - Core Structure):**

* **Phase 1: Basic Content Sequencing UI:**
    * Design a simple interface where users can input and order the segments of their video.
    * Implement the underlying data structure to store the sequence and descriptions.
* **Phase 2: Workflow Integration:**
    * Add a section to the planner that outlines the basic video creation workflow.
    * Link the workflow stages to the content segments, prompting users to consider actions for each.
* **Phase 3: Practical Prompts:**
    * Integrate prompts that encourage users to think about time and resource considerations for their planned content.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch Goal): Simple Plan Output:**
    * Enable users to export their basic video plan in a readable format (e.g., plain text).

**IV. Why This Approach Maximizes Hackathon Potential (Core Structure):**

* **Highly Focused Scope:** By concentrating on the fundamental structure and workflow, the project becomes very manageable within the Hackathon timeframe.
* **Achievable MVP:** A basic planner for sequencing content and outlining workflow is a realistic and valuable deliverable.
* **Provides Foundational Value:** This core planning tool lays the groundwork for more advanced features in the future.
* **Adaptable to Constraints:** The simplicity of the plan accommodates the potential limitations in video output options.

For the `.md` file name, sticking with **`planner-roadmap.md`** still makes sense as it accurately reflects the content â€“ a roadmap for the planner component.
