### Video Planner Roadmap (Screenshot Focused)

**I. Core Objective (Screenshot Emphasis):**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop a "planner" component that *seamlessly integrates presentation details*, with a strong focus on supporting screenshot-based video creation, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
* **MVP:** A user interface that allows developers to input detailed presentation content (text, images, code snippets, etc.) and automatically generates a structured video plan optimized for use with screenshots, including cost-saving strategies and efficient workflows.
* **Key Emphasis:** The tool should minimize the manual effort of translating presentation content into a video script or storyboard, *specifically considering the constraints and opportunities of using screenshots*.

**II. Key Features (Enhanced for Screenshots):**

* **Integrated Content Input:**
    * **Import Presentation Data:** Enable users to import existing presentation files (e.g., Markdown, slide decks, code repositories) directly.
    * **Structured Content Parsing:** Automatically parse imported content to identify key elements (headings, bullet points, code examples, images) and structure them for video adaptation.
    * **Content Transformation (Screenshot Optimized):** Offer tools to adapt presentation content for screenshot-based videos:
        * **Screenshot Guidance:** Provide recommendations on what types of screenshots to capture (e.g., full application window, specific UI elements, code output).
        * **Annotation Planning:** Facilitate the planning of annotations (arrows, text callouts, highlights) to be added to screenshots.
        * **Sequence Planning:** Help users plan the sequence of screenshots to tell a clear and concise story.

* **Automated Plan Generation:**
    * **Script/Storyboard Generation (Screenshot Focused):** Automatically generate a draft script or storyboard optimized for screenshot-based narration:
        * Include placeholders for screenshots.
        * Suggest narration points that describe the screenshots.
        * Provide guidance on timing and pacing for screenshot transitions.
    * **Scene Breakdown (Screenshot Grouping):** Suggest a logical breakdown of the video into scenes, grouping related screenshots.
    * **Visual Asset Suggestions (Screenshot Enhancement):** Recommend ways to enhance screenshots:
        * Suggest tools for adding annotations.
        * Offer guidance on using zoom and pan effects on screenshots.
        * Provide tips for creating visually appealing transitions between screenshots.

* **Cost-Effective Workflow Suggestions (Enhanced for Screenshots):**
    * **Efficient Screenshot Capture:** Recommend tools and techniques for capturing high-quality screenshots quickly.
    * **Free Annotation Tools:** Suggest free or low-cost tools for annotating and editing screenshots.
    * **Streamlined Editing:** Offer guidance on using video editing software to create engaging videos from sequences of screenshots.

* **Iterative Refinement:**
    * **Plan Customization:** Allow users to easily customize the generated plan, adjusting the script, storyboard, and screenshot sequence.
    * **Feedback & Collaboration:** (If time allows) Consider features for sharing the plan and collaborating with team members on screenshot selection and annotation.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focused - Screenshot Driven):**

* **Phase 1: Content Parsing & Structuring:**
    * Develop the core logic for parsing presentation files and extracting relevant content.
    * Design data structures to represent the structured content and its relationship to the screenshot-based video plan.
* **Phase 2: Automated Plan Generation (MVP - Screenshot Optimized):**
    * Implement the algorithms for generating a draft script/storyboard that incorporates screenshot placeholders and narration cues.
    * Focus on creating a basic, functional output that demonstrates the core concept of planning a video using screenshots.
* **Phase 3: UI & Workflow Integration (Screenshot Workflow):**
    * Develop a user interface that allows users to import content, view the generated plan, and customize it, with a workflow tailored for screenshots.
    * Integrate the plan generation with cost-saving and workflow suggestions specific to screenshot-based video creation.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch Goal): Enhanced Refinement & Iteration:**
    * Improve the accuracy and quality of the generated plan, with a focus on screenshot integration.
    * Explore features for iterative refinement and collaboration, including tools for managing and annotating screenshots within the planning process.

**IV. Why This Approach Maximizes Hackathon Potential (Screenshot Focused):**

* **Addresses a Common Use Case:** Many developers create videos using primarily screenshots (e.g., tutorials, demos), so this approach directly addresses a real need.
* **Highly Achievable MVP:** Creating a planner that optimizes for screenshots is a very achievable goal within a Hackathon timeframe.
* **Provides Immediate Value:** Even without full video generation, this tool provides immediate value by making the screenshot-based video creation process much more efficient.
* **Strong Foundation for Future Development:** This approach can be easily extended to incorporate video generation capabilities in the future, building upon the solid foundation of a screenshot-optimized planning tool.
