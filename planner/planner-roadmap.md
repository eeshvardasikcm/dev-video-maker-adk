### Developer Video Creator Roadmap (Manual Decision-Driven Indexing - Planning Phase)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a plan for a manual-entry UI tool for developers to index and document the sequential decisions and rationales made during the creation of a developer-focused video composed of screenshots, where the order of screenshots is determined by the manual capture process.

**II. Key Features:**

* Design for a simple, manual UI for associating a captured screenshot (via file selection or similar) with a specific point in the video creation process.
* Primary focus: Intuitive UI elements for immediately recording the decision, context, and rationale associated with the *current* screenshot through manual text input.
* Design for clear, manual indexing of decisions linked to the sequence of captured screenshots as they are added.
* Emphasis on a natural, manual workflow for documenting the "why" at the point of creation.

**III. Planning Stages (Hackathon Focus) & Documentation of Concepts:**

* **Phase 1: Conceptualization of Manual Screenshot and Decision Entry UI.**
    * **Planning:** Outline the user interface elements and the intended workflow for manually associating screenshots and entering the corresponding decisions and rationales. Consider different UI layouts and input methods.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - UI Concepts):**
        * **Quick Markdown Snippets:** Create a `.md` file (e.g., `phase1_ui_concepts.md`) detailing the proposed UI design for screenshot selection and decision input. Include sketches or descriptions of the UI elements and their intended interaction.
        * **Focus on the "Why" (of the UI Concept):** Document the rationale behind the chosen UI concepts to ensure a natural and intuitive manual entry experience for developers.

* **Phase 2: Design of Sequential Display of Screenshots and Decisions (Manual Order).**
    * **Planning:** Design the UI view that will display the sequence of manually added screenshots and their associated decision text. Consider how the manual order will be visually represented and how the decision text will be presented alongside the screenshots.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Display Design):**
        * **Quick Markdown Snippets:** Create a `.md` file (e.g., `phase2_display_design.md`) describing the proposed design for displaying the manually ordered sequence and decisions. Include mockups or wireframes of the UI view.
        * **Focus on the "Why" (of the Display Design):** Document the design choices for the visual layout to ensure clarity for the developer reviewing their process.

* **Phase 3: Outlining Simple Export of Manual Decision Log.**
    * **Planning:** Outline the structure and format for a basic export of the manually entered log of screenshots and their corresponding decisions. Consider simple output formats like plain text or CSV.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Export Outline):**
        * **Quick Markdown Snippets:** Create a `.md` file (e.g., `phase3_export_outline.md`) describing the proposed structure and format for the exported decision log.
        * **Focus on the "Why" (of the Format Outline):** Explain the rationale behind the chosen export format for representing the manually captured sequence and reasoning.

* **Phase 4 (Stretch): Conceptualizing Basic Manual Reordering (If Time Permits).**
    * **Planning:** If time allows, brainstorm potential UI elements and mechanisms for allowing the developer to manually adjust the order of screenshots and their associated decisions after their initial manual entry.
    * **Documentation (Make It Happen - Reordering Concepts):** Document any conceptual UI ideas for manual reordering and how it might interact with the underlying data structure.

**IV. Why This Matters:**

* Focuses the Hackathon effort on planning and conceptualizing a user-centric manual UI for a developer-focused documentation tool.
* Prioritizes the design of a natural and intuitive experience for capturing the "why" behind each visual element through manual input.
* Provides a solid conceptual foundation for potential future implementation of this valuable developer tool.
