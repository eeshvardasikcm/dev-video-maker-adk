### Video Planner Roadmap (Core Sequence)

**I. Goal:**

* Develop a basic "planner" to define the sequential order and key narrative for a video composed of screenshots.

**II. Key Features:**

* Simple interface for inputting a sequence of screenshots.
* Ability to add a brief description/narrative for each screenshot.
* Clear indication of the planned order.

**III. Development Stages (Hackathon Focus):**

* **Phase 1:** Basic UI for ordering screenshots.
* **Phase 2:** Add narrative input for each screenshot.
* **Phase 3:** Display the planned sequence and narrative.
* **Phase 4 (Stretch):** Simple export of the plan.

**IV. Why This Matters:**

* Provides a foundational tool for planning screenshot-based videos within the Hackathon timeframe.
* Establishes the core logic for future video creation features.
