## Agentic Video Maker: for Developer Steps (Content Creation)

This is a new repository that I will set up on GitHub for the purpose of documenting developer-oriented projects. This repository will begin with Copyright Eeshvar Das (me), but might possibly become an open source repository early during the Hackathon. This Agentic Video Maker is also being entered as a submission into the ADK Hackathon Sponsored by Google. This project, hopefully will be less complex and easier to finalize a submission.

### Developer Steps

During the development of developer oriented creator processes, the Developer Steps is part of my Agentic Video Maker for guiding the developer through a simplified documentation process that involves uploading screenshots, and descriptions of the developer steps, to my agent that will generate videos for the steps during development.

### Project Documentation Plan

For a detailed plan and timeline regarding the documentation strategy for the Hackathon video submission, please see the **[Project Documentation Kickoff](./documentation-kickstart.md)**. This document outlines the initial steps and priorities for generating video and blog-style documentation using this Agentic Video Maker.}
