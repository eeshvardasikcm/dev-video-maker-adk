## Content Creator: Agentic Video Maker: for Developer Steps
This is a new repository that I will set up on GitHub for the purpose of documenting my Agentic Expense Reducer. This repository will begin with Copyright Eeshvar Das (me), but might possibly become an open source repository early during the Hackathon.
### Developer Steps
During the development of developer oriented creator processes, the Developer Steps is part of my Agentic Video Maker for guiding the developer through a simplified documentation process that involves uploading screenshots, and descriptions of the developer steps,  to my agent that will generate videos for the steps during development.
