Terms and Conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution
1.  Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such derivative works in Source or Object form.
2.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You are hereby granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated below) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) and the Work to which such Contribution(s) was contributed. If any third party institutes patent litigation against You (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes patent infringement, then any patent license granted to You under this Agreement for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
3.  Acceptance. By using, reproducing, or distributing the Work, You accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
    1.  You must give the other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this Agreement; and
    2.  You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
    3.  You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices which do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
    4.  If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices which do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: in a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; in the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addition to the text from the NOTICE file provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted by You for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner shall be under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with such copyright owner regarding such Contributions.
6.  Trademarks. This Agreement does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this Agreement.
8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
