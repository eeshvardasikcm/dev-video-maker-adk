# Veo 2 Integration Exploration for Dev Video Maker

This document outlines the current considerations for integrating Veo 2 into the Dev Video Maker project for video generation. This exploration acknowledges the recent decision that this specific integration **may not be part of the immediate Hackathon submission process**.

**Project Owner:** Eeshvar Das

**Current Team:** Eeshvar Das (Solo) - Open to potential team members joining.

## Current Focus: Veo 2 Integration Exploration (Separate from Hackathon Submission)

The primary focus regarding Veo 2 is now on **exploring its potential integration into the Dev Video Maker project**, with the understanding that this specific aspect might not be a core component of the Hackathon submission. This allows for a more investigative and potentially less time-constrained approach to understanding Veo 2's capabilities.

The rationale for this exploration includes:

* **Future Feature Potential:** Veo 2's high-quality output remains a desirable future feature for the Dev Video Maker.
* **Learning and Experimentation:** This provides an opportunity to learn about Veo 2's API or manual workflows without the immediate pressure of Hackathon deadlines.
* **Informing Future Development:** Insights gained from this exploration will be valuable for the long-term development roadmap of the Dev Video Maker.

## Core of the Hackathon Submission: [To be Determined Separately]

The central submission for the Hackathon will be determined through a separate strategic process. This document now focuses specifically on the exploration of Veo 2 integration as a potentially parallel or subsequent effort.

## Important Consideration: Veo 2 Usage (Exploration Phase)

As this is now primarily an exploration, the key considerations shift towards understanding Veo 2's potential without the immediate constraints of the Hackathon:

* **Reviewing Veo 2 Capabilities:** Investigating its features, potential APIs, SDKs, or manual workflows relevant to video generation.
* **Veo 2 Terms of Service:** Understanding Veo 2's terms of service for general usage and development.
* **API Key and Access (for future potential):** Familiarizing oneself with the process for obtaining necessary API keys or access credentials for Veo 2 for potential future integration.
* **Potential Restrictions (for future awareness):** Identifying any limitations on video generation quotas, watermarking, or content restrictions for future planning.

**The immediate next step is for Eeshvar Das to begin exploring Veo 2's capabilities and potential integration points, independent of the Hackathon submission timeline.**

## Immediate Next Steps (Veo 2 Exploration)

1.  **Initial Veo 2 Capability Research:** Begin researching Veo 2's features, documentation, and any available APIs or SDKs.
2.  **Manual Workflow Exploration:** If an API/SDK isn't the immediate focus, explore Veo 2's manual video generation capabilities and how they might align with the Dev Video Maker's goals.
3.  **High-Level Integration Brainstorming:** Start brainstorming potential ways Veo 2 could be integrated into the Dev Video Maker architecture in the future.
4.  **Dependency Awareness (for future):** Keep a mental note of any potential dependencies that might arise from a future Veo 2 integration.

## Potential Considerations (Long-Term)

* **Cost and Access:** Future integration will need to consider any costs associated with Veo 2 usage.
* **Complexity and Learning Curve:** Understanding the intricacies of Veo 2 will be a longer-term effort.
* **Integration Strategy:** A clear strategy for how Veo 2 will interact with the core Dev Video Maker will need to be developed.

## Contributions

While currently solo, potential team members are welcome to contribute to the core Dev Video Maker project, the direction of which for the Hackathon will be determined separately. Input on Veo 2 exploration is also welcome for long-term planning.
