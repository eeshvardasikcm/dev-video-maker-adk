# Agentic Video Maker - Project Documentation Kickoff

**Date:** May 15, 2025

**Status:** Project Initiated - Urgent Timeline

## Purpose

This document marks the official start of the documentation process for the "Agentic Expense Reducer" project, utilizing the "Content Creator: Agentic Video Maker." Our primary goal is to generate compelling video and blog-style documentation for the Google Cloud ADK Hackathon submission.

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** We have less than 40 days until the final video submission deadline for the Hackathon. Action is required immediately.

## Project Repositories

1.  **Agentic Expense Reducer:**
    * **Copyright:** Eeshvar Das (Currently not open source. Potential to become open source post-Hackathon).
    * **Purpose:** The primary project being documented.
    * **Note:** Created specifically for the Hackathon.

2.  **Content Creator: Agentic Video Maker:** (This Repository)
    * **Copyright:** Eeshvar Das (Initially. Potential to become open source early in the Hackathon).
    * **Purpose:** To manage and facilitate the agentic video generation process for documenting the "Agentic Expense Reducer."
    * **Potential Future Purpose:** To serve as a general tool for anyone needing to document a developer-oriented project, provided they follow the structured input guides provided by the agent.

## Documentation Strategy Overview

Our core strategy is to leverage the "Agentic Video Maker" to streamline and automate the creation of video documentation. The focus will be on capturing and presenting the developer's journey and the step-by-step process of building the "Agentic Expense Reducer."

## Immediate Priorities & Initial Steps

The absolute first priority is to begin **agentic video generation**.

### Developer Steps Documentation Workflow:

The "Agentic Video Maker" is designed with a "Developer Steps" section. The intended workflow is as follows:

1.  **Capture Developer Actions:** As development on the "Agentic Expense Reducer" progresses, the developer will:
    * Take screenshots of key stages, code snippets, or UI elements.
    * Write brief, clear descriptions for each screenshot or step.
2.  **Upload to Agent:** Upload these screenshots and descriptions to the "Agentic Video Maker" agent.
3.  **Agent-Generated Video:** The agent will process this input to generate individual video segments for each developer step.
4.  **Narrative Focus:** The initial videos will focus on telling the story of the development process, beginning with:
    * Project Introduction.
    * Step-by-step documentation of the development of the "Agentic Expense Reducer," starting with "Step One."

## Next Actions (To Be Initiated ASAP)

1.  **Set up "Agentic Video Maker" environment:** Ensure the agent is ready to receive input.
2.  **Define "Step One" of "Agentic Expense Reducer":** Clearly outline the first development step that needs to be documented.
3.  **Begin Capturing:** Start taking screenshots and writing descriptions for the introduction and "Step One."
4.  **First Upload & Video Generation Test:** Perform an initial test of uploading content and generating the first video segments via the "Agentic Video Maker."

Let's move quickly and efficiently to meet the Hackathon deadline!
